# Network Science Course - Final Project
Friendship networks and educational networks and their connection:
In the ever-evolving campus environment, the interconnectedness of students forms a complex network that is as fascinating as it is influential. This article explores two networks of communication between students and the network of common courses taken by students in the current semester, in the faculty environment of the Faculty of Physics at Sharif University of Technology with the perspective of network science.
Network science is a multidisciplinary field that has seen significant growth in recent years due to advances in computational methods and increased access to large-scale data. Key literature in this field has examined the structure and dynamics of various networks, from social networks to biological networks. Related concepts include centrality measures community detection algorithms, and network motifs that can be used to understand complex communications in academic settings.
