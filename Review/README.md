# Network Science Course - Review
In this paper, the authors examine how the structure of groups and their interrelationships in a population can influence the spread of an infectious disease. They argue that people who participate in group activities or shared environments, such as students enrolled in the same class or living in a dormitory, are exposed to frequent contact of physical proximity, which is known to mediate the spread of an infectious disease.
The key findings of this study are that changing the organizational form of groups in a population can be used as an effective strategy to reduce the severity of an epidemic Specifically, they show that when group structures are sufficiently correlated (for example, two students in the same dorm are sufficiently likely to take the same class), outbreaks are longer but milder than in uncorrelated group structures. In addition, by increasing the correlation between group structures, the effectiveness of interventions to contain the disease increases. They illustrate the practical relevance of their findings using data on housing and student attendance at the Indiana University Bloomington campus
